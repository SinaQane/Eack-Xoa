A Social Media just like Twitter...

You can create/login to your accounts, change their privacy status, last online status, info status, set a usename, password, email, name, phone number, birthdate and bio foe yourself, search for other users and tweets, follow/unfollow them (send follow request if they're private), message them, like/dislike their tweets, retweet them ot leave comments under their tweets.

There are multiple sections like home, timeline, explore, notification, settings, ...

You can pretty much do anything you can do in the real twitter app.

This is for phase 1 of the project. So its just using CLI (GUI will be added in the phase 2) and its offline for now (network will be added in the phase 3).
