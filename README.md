A Social Media just like Twitter...

You can create/login to your accounts, change their privacy status, last online status, info status, set a usename, password, email, name, phone number, birthdate and bio foe yourself, search for other users and tweets, follow/unfollow them (send follow request if they're private), message them, like/dislike their tweets, retweet them ot leave comments under their tweets.

There are multiple sections like home, timeline, explore, notification, settings, ...

You can pretty much do anything you can do in the real twitter app.

This is for phase 1 of my AP project for university. So its just using CLI and it's not really clean (GUI and Clean Code are parts of the phase 2) and its offline (network will be added in the phase 3) for now.

I'll add some info soon enough...
